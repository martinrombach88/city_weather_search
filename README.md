# city_weather_search
A search app for the weather of the city.

The purpose of this application is allow users to enter any city of their choice into a search bar and return the weather for that city. 
The weather information is retrieved from Open Weather via an API. Unlike the Star Wars Quote generator, weather app
has a dedicated API retrieved using an API key from a well established website, so it doesn't have the issues of
the previous project. The view displays weather information for five days in stylised cards.


Today's card includes:
- The day
- A description of the weather
- An icon for the weather
- The temperature
- The wind speed
- The humidity
- The air pressure
- The cloudiness

Other days include:
- The day

The app is built using Javascript. A goal is to aim for generic, independent functions in the build and to use a modular structure where possible.
