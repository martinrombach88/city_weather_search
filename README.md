# city_weather_search
A search app for the weather of the city.

The purpose of this application is allow users to search any city of their choice and return the weather for that city. 
The weather information is retrieved from Open Weather via an API. Unlike the Star Wars Quote generator, weather app
has a dedicated API retrieved using an API key from a well established website, so it doesn't have the issues of
the previous project. The view displays weather information for five days in stylised cards.

- The day
- A description of the weather
- An icon for the weather
- The temperature
- The wind speed
- The humidity
- The air pressure
- The cloudiness
